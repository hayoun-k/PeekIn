              <h2>Our Lawful Bases for Processing</h2>
              <p>We will only process your Personal Information if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include, depending on the applicable law, consent, contractual necessity, and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below. </p>
              <section class="comply">
                <h3 class="underline">Necessary to comply with a Legal/ Regulatory Obligation</h3>
                <p>From time to time, we may also need to process Personal Information to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. We rely on this lawful basis when processing any data subject rights requests in accordance with applicable data protection laws and for activities relating to the prevention, detection and investigation of any crime. We also rely on it to comply with our financial reporting obligations and compliance with subpoenas or similar court orders.</p>
              </section>
              <section class="interest">
                <h3 class="underline">Vital Interests/ tasks carried out in public interest</h3>
                <p>We may also need to process Personal Information if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. </p>
              </section>
              <section class="contract">
                <h3 class="underline">Necessary to fulfill a contract</h3>
                <p>Other activities are carried out to fulfill a contract or agreement. If a contract or account is in place, then we will process your Personal Information on the basis that it is necessary to perform our contractual commitments to you. </p>
              </section>
              <section class="legitimate">
                <h3 class="underline">Legitimate Interests</h3>
                <ul>In addition to the uses set out above, we may also process the Personal Information we collect for our legitimate business interests when that is an available legal basis under applicable law.  “Legitimate Interests” means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and products and the most secure experience. Our legitimate interests can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well. Specifically, we may also process the Personal Information we collect on the basis of the following legitimate business interests: 
                  <li>where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services and communications for the benefit of our customers; </li>
                  <li>to enhance the security of our network and information systems; </li>
                  <li>to better understand how people interact with our software or services; </li>
                  <li>to review and update the information we hold on you, to ensure it is accurate and up to date; </li>
                  <li>for analysis and research in connection with product offerings and development; </li>
                  <li>promoting our products and services; and </li>
                  <li>for direct marketing purposes (where this is permitted) and to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we consider 3 questions: is there a legitimate interest behind the use of your Personal Information? Is our use necessary for that purpose and do your rights override our legitimate interest? We always keep your rights in high regard and we take steps to ensure your Personal Information is not used in ways other than those you would expect.  We will not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by applicable data protection law). </p>
                <p>Where legitimate interest, or one of the other legal basis referred to above, isn’t available under applicable data protection law for the processing described under that subheading, then we will apply another alternative legal basis to enable us to carry out that data processing, or adjust the processing undertaken accordingly.</p>
