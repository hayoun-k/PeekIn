          <p>Effective as of November 3, 2022. </p>
          <p>These General Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of and access to our websites, web-based applications and products, customer support, discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, (collectively, the “Services”) and your installation and use of any software that Adam Smith Software LLC (“Smith Software”) includes as part of the Services, including, without limitation, mobile and desktop applications, sample files and content files, scripts, instruction sets, and related documentation (collectively, the “Software”)</p>
          <p>BY USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS.</p>
          <ol class="terms">
            <li><span class="text-bold">Agreement.</span>
              <ol>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Choice of Law and Contracting Entity.</span> The Terms are governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Hawaii, U.S.A., unless preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules. </li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Updates to Terms.</span> We may make changes to the Terms from time to time, and if we do, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the Terms and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and Smith Software arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms incorporating such changes, or when the Terms otherwise become effective. You should look at the Terms regularly. Unless otherwise noted, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services and/or Software confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services and Software and, if applicable, cancel your subscription.</li>

              <ol>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Privacy. </span>For information about how we collect, use, share, or otherwise process information about you and your use of our Services and Software, please see our Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Sensitive Personal Information. </span>You agree not to collect, process, or store any Sensitive Personal Information (as defined below) using the Services and Software, except as (A) directly authorized by Smith Software, or (B) intended by the Services and Software. You agree not to transmit, disclose, or make available Sensitive Personal Information to Smith Software. “<span class="text-bold">Sensitive Personal Information</span>” means an individual’s financial information, data concerning an individual’s sexual behavior or sexual orientation, medical, or health information protected under any health data protection laws, biometric data, personal information of children protected under any child data protection laws (such as the personal information defined under the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<span class="text-bold">COPPA</span>”)) and any additional types of information included within this term or any similar term (such as “sensitive personal data” or “special categories of personal information”) as used in applicable data protection or privacy laws. </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Use of Services and Software.</span>
              <ol>
                <li><span class="text-bold">License. </span>Subject to your compliance with the Terms and applicable law, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, limited, revocable right for you to install, access and use the Services and Software that we make available to you, and that you license from us. Each license is to be used by only one (1) person and cannot be shared. You agree that your decision to use, access, or license the Services and Software is not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by us regarding future functionality or features.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Smith Software Intellectual Property. </span>We (and our licensors, as applicable) remain the sole owner of all right, title, and interest in the Services and Software. Except as stated in the Terms, we do not grant you any rights to patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, or any other rights in respect to the items in the Services or Software. This means you may not use our trade names, trademarks, service marks or logos in connection with any product or service that is not ours, or in any manner that is likely to cause confusion. We reserve all rights not granted under the Terms.  </li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">User-Generated Content. </span>We may host user-generated content from our users. If you access our Services or Software, you may come across user-generated content that you find offensive or upsetting. We bear no responsibility for such user-generated content and your sole remedy is to stop viewing the content. If available, you may also click on the “Report” button to report offensive user-generated content to us.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Your Content and Conduct. </span>You may be able to upload content to the Service. You may use your content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload content, you must not submit to the Service any content that does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, the content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Rights you Grant. </span>You retain ownership rights in your content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to Smith Software and other users of the Service, as described. By providing content to the Service, you grant to Smith Software a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and Smith Software’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service. You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your content through the Service, and to use that content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your content independent of the Service. The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that Sith Software may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted. You grant to Smith Software the right to monetize your content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. </li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Sharing Your Content.</span></li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Feedback. </span>You may, at your own discretion, choose to provide us with ideas, suggestions, proposals, or bug or crash reports for the Services or Software ("Feedback"). In such event, you agree that we are the owner of such Feedback, and we are free to use it for our business purposes, including by incorporation into the Services and Software without any payment or attribution or other obligation to you.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><span class="text-bold">Your Account.</span>
              <ol>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Account Information. </span>You are responsible for all activity that occurs via your account even if that activity is not by you or is without your knowledge or consent. You may not (A) share your account information (except with an authorized account administrator), whether intentionally or unintentionally; or (B) use another person’s account. Your account administrator may use your account information to manage your use and access to the Services. </li>
                <li><span class="text-bold">Account Security. </span>You are responsible for taking reasonable steps to maintain the security and control of your account. Smith Software assumes no responsibility for any loss that you may sustain due to a compromise of your account login credentials, or your failure to follow or act on any notices or alerts that we may send to your email address or telephone number. You are responsible for keeping your email address and telephone number up to date in order to receive any notices or alerts that we may send you, and you are also responsible for carefully reviewing any messages purporting to be from Smith Software to ensure they are legitimate. We assume no responsibility if you are unable to access your account because you cannot provide the appropriate login credentials, such as a password, email address, or telephone number. </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
